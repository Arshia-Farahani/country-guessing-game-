# country-guessing-game
There are two players in this game.
  Player number one must name a two to six letter country and then spell it.
Then it is the second player's turn. The second player must try to find the word of the first player's desired country in a limited number of chances, which he does by guessing the letters in the word of the first player's desired country.
The game here tells the player if he has guessed the number two letter correctly and then shows the location of the letter in the word.
Then, in the last chance, player number two must guess the entire word of the country of player number one.
